Notes for myself from HM instructions:


ORIGIN: refers to the name of the remote repository

MASTER: refers to the name of the branch

Repositories can have many branches. 

It is possible to create references to other repositories (called remotes) within my current repo and customiz ethe names. 

Notes for myself:

Ask about point 4 in exercise 1. 

Now create a remote to the course playground. Which remote should it be?
Then fetch: how?
